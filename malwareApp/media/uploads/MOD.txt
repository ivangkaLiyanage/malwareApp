data.py - Loads the pickle file within to run the model and gives an output for the code.

Calling the final.pkl file from data.py
model_file_path = r'C:\Users\student\Documents\Model\final.pkl' 

Calling the file to analyse .txt (malware or not malware)
file_to_analyze =  r'C:\Users\student\Documents\Model\j.txt.txt'  # Update with the file path

-------
